This package contains examples of how to use LAMBO in different scenarios:

* ``run_usage.py`` -- use standalone LAMBO for segmentation
* ``run_usage_COMBO.py`` -- use LAMBO as segmentation layer for COMBO
* ``run_training.py`` -- train LAMBO models from UD training data
* ``run_pretraining.py`` -- train pretraining LAMBO models from OSCAR corpora
* ``run_training_pretrained.py`` -- train LAMBO models on UD training data, starting from pretrained models
* ``run_training_splitting.py`` -- train LAMBO models for splitting multi-word tokens
* ``run_tuning.py`` -- tune existing LAMBO model to fit new data
* ``run_evaluation.py`` -- evaluate existing models using UD gold standard
